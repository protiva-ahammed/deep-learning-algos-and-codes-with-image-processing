Deeplearning algorithm implementation in microscopic images for acute lymphoblastic leukemea.
There are a transfer learning model based ob resnet50 and a novel model building with adding layers in densenet.
Before training the data-set data was augmented, cropped, reseized,brightness was adjusted,saturation and contrast, thresholds were changed to observe the impacts.
Implementation technologies:
python
numpy
seaborne
pandas
tensorflow
deep learning algorithms
Image processing fundamentals, algorithms
